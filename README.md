Description : 
This repository hosts codes for the numerical experiments conducted in the paper "A Multiordering Newsvendor Model with Dynamic Forecast Evolution."

<FNV-MMFE/src> folder hosts the C++ code for the four models developed in the paper and its e-companion: additive MMFE, multiplicative MMFE, additive MMFE with fixed ordering costs, and additive MMFE with order cancelations. The codes essentially solve the Dynamic Programs developed in the paper to obtain the optimal inventory control policies and then run Monte Carlo simulations to compare the optimal multi-ordering and single-ordering strategies. 

<FNV-MMFE/output> folder hosts the raw output data files generated by the C++ codes, the R scripts for cleaning, organizing, summarising, and plotting these data, and the final output (in the format of Tables and Figures) published in the paper.

Instructions
============

The C++ codes are re-written using the new C++11 standard library and the Boost C++ Library (http://www.boost.org/). In order to compile them, you will need:
(1). An update-to-date C++ compiler (GNU GCC 4.7 or Intel C++ Compiler 13.0) supporting C++11 and OpenMP
(2). Install the Boost Library (v1.53.0 or newer, check it out at http://www.boost.org/). The default root directory of the Boost Library is "/usr/local/boost_1_53_0".
(3). Compile by command: g++ -std=c++11 -fopenmp -O3 -I /usr/local/boost_1_53_0 -o FNV-aMMFE.exe FNV-aMMFE.cpp

The R scripts requires a working R environment (http://www.r-project.org/). The script is only tested on R version 2.15.2, but should be running smoothly on newer versions. The scripts do not require extra R packages.
